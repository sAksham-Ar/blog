I am writing this blog to share what I have learnt by trying to dockerize a simple Flask app.\nWhat is Docker?\nDocker is an open source containerizing platform, It enables developers package their applications into containers.\nWhat is a Container?\nAccording to Google,\n\nContainers are lightweight packages of your application code together with dependencies such as specific versions of programming language runtimes and libraries required to run your software services.\n\nWhat are the advantages of Docker?\nThe major advantage of using docker is that you do not need to setup your application again and again for different servers, you can just create a docker image once and then deploy it easily on other servers. It also helps when different applications require different versions dependencies as running them in separate containers prevents dependency conflict.\nBuilding the Application\nLet us take a simple Flask app and try to dockerize it. \nCode of the app:\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import errorcode\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef connect():\n    try:\n        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host=\"localhost\",\n            user=\"docker_user\",\n            password=\"Docker@123\",\n            database=\"docker\"\n        )\n        return \"Connected\"\n    except mysql.connector.Error as err:\n        if err.errno == errorcode.ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR:\n            return \"Something is wrong with your user name or password\"\n        elif err.errno == errorcode.ER_BAD_DB_ERROR:\n            return \"Database does not exist\"\n        else:\n            return str(err)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\nRequirements of the app:\nmysql-connector-python\nflask\n\nThe app just tries to connect to MySQL as user docker_user to access database docker and returns\nConnected if the connection is successful.\nNow we need to create this user and database in MySQL.\nStart the MySQL client and run the following commands,\nCREATE DATABASE docker;\nCREATE USER docker_user@'localhost' identified by 'Docker@123';\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON docker.* TO docker_user;\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\n\nThis first creates the database docker, then it creates the user docker_user and then grants privileges of the database docker to docker_user.\nNow after running the app and visiting it in the browser we see,\n\nDockerizing the Application\nTo create an image from the application, we would need to write a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile for this application is,\n# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1\n\nFROM python:3.9-slim-buster\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . .\nARG FLASK_PORT=5000\nENV FLASK_PORT=$FLASK_PORT\nENTRYPOINT python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${FLASK_PORT}\n\nHere we are first taking a base image of python3.9 which already has python and pip installed, then we are a creating a working directory so that we can write relative paths. We then copy our requirements.txt to our working directory and install the packages needed. Finally, we copy our code, taking port as an environment variable, and run the app.\nNote: it is important to run the flask app on 0.0.0.0 else we will note be able to forward it.\nNow, we can build the image using,\ndocker build --tag flask-docker .\n\nNow using docker images we can see that our image has been built,\n\nNow for MySQL, there is already an official image on docker hub (it is a website from where docker gets images uploaded by other people), we just need to pass our environment variables,\ndocker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=\"Docker@123\" -e MYSQL_DATABASE=\"docker\" -e MYSQL_USER=\"docker_user\" -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=\"Docker@123\" -d mysql\n\nHere -d is for running in detached mode, by default docker is attached to the terminal so when we close it our application will also close.\nNow, let's run our app on port 5000,\ndocker run --name app -e FLASK_PORT=\"5000\" -p 5000:5000 -d flask-docker\n\nThe -p flag maps the port 5000 of our pc to 5000 of the Docker conatiner.\n\nNetworks\nAs we can see our app cannot reach the database even though the database is running this is because they are running in separate containers. With Docker, we can add them both in the same network.\nFirst let us create a network,\ndocker network create my_network\n\nThen, changing the host in our app.py to name of the MySQL container db and rebuilding the image,\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom mysql.connector import errorcode\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef connect():\n    try:\n        mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n            host=\"db\",\n            user=\"docker_user\",\n            password=\"Docker@123\",\n            database=\"docker\"\n        )\n        return \"Connected\"\n    except mysql.connector.Error as err:\n        if err.errno == errorcode.ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR:\n            return \"Something is wrong with your user name or password\"\n        elif err.errno == errorcode.ER_BAD_DB_ERROR:\n            return \"Database does not exist\"\n        else:\n            return str(err)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n\nFinally, we rerun our db and app with this network,\ndocker run --name db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=\"Docker@123\" -e MYSQL_DATABASE=\"docker\" -e MYSQL_USER=\"docker_user\" -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=\"Docker@123\" -d  --network my_network mysql\ndocker run --name app -e FLASK_PORT=\"5000\" -p 5000:5000 -d --network my_network flask-docker\n\nNow going to http://localhost:5000/,\n\nDocker-compose\nAs you can probably see that the commands we have to run have become very long, and we need to rerun then every time we change our image or our configuration. The solution to this is docker-compose, we just need to create a docker-compose.yml file.\nFor our current setup:\nversion: \"3.9\"\nservices: \n  app: \n    image: flask-docker\n    ports:\n      - \"5000:5000\"\n    environment:\n      - FLASK_PORT=5000\n  \n  db:\n    image: mysql\n    ports:\n      - \"3306:3306\"\n    environment:\n      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Docker@123\n      - MYSQL_DATABASE=docker\n      - MYSQL_USER=docker_user\n      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=Docker@123\n\nNote: Different versions of docker-compose has different syntax see here.\nNow to run our setup we just need to run,\ndocker-compose up -d\n\ndocker-compose already creates a default network, so we do not need to create another.\nConclusion\nNow we have reduced our setup to a single command after installing docker and docker-compose. \nBy default, data stored in Docker is written in the writable container layer which no longer exists after the container is destroyed, and it is also difficult to move. For persistent data you should use volumes. \nYou are encouraged to learn more about docker at the official docs.\n","id":"https://sakshamar.in/posts/introduction-to-docker/","title":"Introduction to Docker"},"https://sakshamar.in/posts/kubernetes/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis Year's Opensoft Problem Statement was very interesting from a DevOps perspective. Basically, we had to convert a Monolithic Application to Microservices, Dockerize the microservices and then deploy them on Kubernetes.\nInitial Set-up\nWe choose Google Kubernetes Engine for hosting because of their very good free trial($300 in credits for first three months). Using local docker images would have been very time-consuming as we had to make sure they were present on all the nodes, I decided to push my images to GitHub Container Registry.\nFirstly, creating a Personal Access Token on GitHub and logging in on GHCR from docker,\nexport CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN\necho $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin\n\nThen tagging and pushing the image on ghcr, \ndocker tag image_name ghcr.io/github_username/image_name\ndocker push ghcr.io/github_username/image_name\n\nThen, I created a cluster on GKE. I also downloaded the google-cloud-sdk and authorized it so that I could control the remote cluster using the kubectl command on my system,\ngcloud auth\ngcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster_name --zone zone_name --project project_name\n\nCreating a secret to pull images from ghcr,\nkubectl create secret docker-registry github-secret --docker-server=https://ghcr.io --docker-username=github_username --docker-password=github_pat --docker-email=github_email\n\nDeploying a MicroService\nFirstly, we created the deployment of the database for the microservice. Here we are using Postgres,\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-db-deployment\n  labels:\n    type: essential\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      name: restaurant-db\n  replicas: 1\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      name: restaurant-db-pod\n      labels:\n        name: restaurant-db\n    spec:\n      containers: \n      - name: restaurant-db-container\n        image: postgres\n        env:\n        - name: POSTGRES_USER\n          value: restaurant\n        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD\n          value: restaurant\n        - name: POSTGRES_DB\n          value: restaurant\n        volumeMounts:\n            - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data\n              name: postgredb\n              subPath: postgres\n      volumes:\n        - name: postgredb\n          persistentVolumeClaim:\n            claimName: restaurant-db-pvc\n\nNote: without subPath the pod does not start. (see here for more details.)\nAs we want our database data to persist, we need to create a Persistent Volume Claim.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-db-pvc\nspec:\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 1Gi\n\nWe do not need to create a Persistent Volume as GKE automatically provisions a Persistent Volume when a PVC is bound.\nFor the microservice we first create the config map,\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-config\ndata:\n  DJANGO_SECRET_KEY: XXXXX\n  DJANGO_DEBUG: \"True\"\n  RABBITMQ_URL: XXXXX\n  IS_DEPLOYED: \"True\"\n  PORT: \"8000\"\n  DATABASE_URL: postgres://restaurant:restaurant@restaurant-db/restaurant\n\nWe are using RabbitMQ to keep our databases in sync, read more here.\nAfter the Config Map, we create the deployment for the microservice,\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-ms-deployment\n  labels:\n    type: essential\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      name: restaurant-ms\n  replicas: 3\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      name: restaurant-ms-pod\n      labels:\n        name: restaurant-ms\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: restaurant-ms-container\n        image: ghcr.io/saksham-ar/restaurant-ms:v2\n        command: [\"/bin/sh\",\"-c\"]\n        args: [\"python manage.py migrate &amp;&amp;\n          python manage.py collectstatic --noinput &amp;&amp;\n          python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000\"]\n        envFrom:\n          - configMapRef:\n              name: restaurant-config\n      imagePullSecrets:\n        - name: github-secret\n\nCreating Services\nTill this point, we have written the deployment files but, there is no way for the microservice deployment to access the database. For this we create a service ClusterIp,\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-db\n  labels:\n    app: restaurant-ms\nspec:\n  selector:\n    name: restaurant-db\n  ports:\n    - port: 5432\n      targetPort: 5432\n\nThis microservice will access this through the DATABASE_URL we have given in the Config Map of the microservice. Now starting the microservice with,\nkubectl create -f restaurant-config.yml\nkubectl create -f restaurant-db-pvc.yml\nkubectl create -f restaurant-db-deploy.yml\nkubectl create -f restaurant-db-service.yml\nkubectl create -f restaurant-deploy.yml\n\nNow to make the microservice accessible on a port on the nodes we create a NodePort microservice,\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: restaurant-ms-service\n  labels:\n    app: restaurant-ms\nspec:\n  type: NodePort\n  selector:\n    name: restaurant-ms\n  ports:\n    - port: 8000\n      targetPort: 8000\n      nodePort: 30006\n\nStarting this will make the microservice available on the port 30006 of all nodes,\nkubectl create -f restaurant-service.yml\n\nIngress\nNow, we can see the microservice on http://node-ip:30006 of all nodes but, we want only a singular ip that can send the request to all nodes. This is where Load Balancer and Ingress are useful.\nI am using nginx-ingress-controller here. Installing from helm,\nhelm install nginx-ingress nginx-stable/nginx-ingress --set prometheus.create=true\n\nprometheus.create=true provides metrics from nginx for prometheus. \nThis automatically provisions a load balancer in Google Cloud which will give us a Singular IP. Now we need to define rules for routing, so we can access multiple microservices from the same IP,\napiVersion: k8s.nginx.org/v1\nkind: VirtualServer\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress\nspec:\n  host: opensoft.example.com\n  upstreams:\n  - name: restaurant\n    service: restaurant-ms-service\n    port: 8000\n  \n  routes:\n  - path: ~/restaurant/?(.*)\n    action:\n      proxy:\n        upstream: restaurant\n        rewritePath: /$1\n\nThe rewritePath here converts /restaurant/login to /login so, we would not need to change the routes in all our microservices.

Basically, we had to convert a Monolithic Application to Microservices, Dockerize the microservices and then deploy them on Kubernetes.\nThe Problem\nWe have created 7 microservices and each microservice has its own database, but some data has to be shared between multiple microservices. Keeping a single database for these defeats the point of creating microservices. We ended up using RabbitMQ for keeping the important data in sync between microservices.\nRabbitMQ\nIn RabbitMQ, each microservice has its own queue and all essential microservices can produce data to these queues. We used fanout type of exchange where every producer published to all the queues. Each microservice then consumes the message and acts according to the properties.content_type which we sent during producing.\nProducing\nFor producing in Django, we just have to write a producer.py,\nimport pika, json\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nRABBITMQ_URL = settings.RABBITMQ_URL\nparams = pika.URLParameters(RABBITMQ_URL+\"?heartbeat=600&amp;\"+\"blocked_connection_timeout=300\")\n\ndef publish(method, body):\n    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(params)\n\n    exchange_queue = 'logs'\n    channel = connection.channel()\n    channel.exchange_declare(exchange=exchange_queue, exchange_type='fanout')   \n\n    properties = pika.BasicProperties(method)\n    channel.basic_publish(exchange=exchange_queue, routing_key='', body=json.dumps(body), properties=properties)\n\n    connection.close()\n\nNow wherever we want to publish, we just import the publish function and send the method(which defines the properties.content_type) and the body.\nConsuming\nFor consuming, we have to write a consumer.py. An example from the Restaurant Menu microservice which keeps track of items of each restaurant,\nimport pika, json\nimport os\nimport django\nfrom sys import path\n\npath.append(os.getcwd()+'/restaurant_menu/settings.py')\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'restaurant_menu.settings') \ndjango.setup()\nfrom restaurant_menu_app.models import Restaurant, MenuItem\nfrom restaurant_menu_app.serializers import RestaurantSerializer, MenuItemSerializer\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password\nfrom restaurant_menu_app.producer import publish\n\nRABBITMQ_URL = settings.RABBITMQ_URL\n\nparams = pika.URLParameters(RABBITMQ_URL)\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(params)\n\nexchange_queue = 'logs'\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.exchange_declare(exchange=exchange_queue, exchange_type='fanout')\n\nresult = channel.queue_declare(queue='', exclusive=True)\nqueue_name = result.method.queue\n\nexchange_queue = 'logs'\nchannel.queue_bind(exchange=exchange_queue, queue=queue_name)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print(\"Received in Restaurant Menu Item Application\", flush=True)\n    data = json.loads(body)\n\n    elif properties.content_type == 'RESTAURANT_CREATED':\n        data[\"password\"] = make_password(data[\"password\"])\n        serializer = RestaurantSerializer(data=data)\n        if serializer.is_valid():\n            serializer.save()\n\nWe have to run consumer.py separate from our Django application and this will keep the important data in sync.\nSyncing Data between Clusters\nFor the Problem Statement we had to deploy 2 clusters. For keeping the data of same microservices in sync in different clusters, what we did was when a new data was being sent to the backend we did not save it, rather we published to RabbitMQ. The RabbitMQ queue does the job of keeping the data in sync with the same microservice from the other cluster. For example in consumer.py of the Restaurant microservice,\n    if(properties.content_type==\"RESTAURANT_SIGNUP\"):\n        # If a restaurnat signups\n        raw_password = data[\"password\"]\n        data[\"password\"] = make_password(raw_password)\n        serializer = RestaurantSerializer(data=data)\n        if(serializer.is_valid()):\n            restaurant = serializer.save()\n            data_to_be_published = {\n                'restaurant_id': restaurant.restaurant_id,\n                'email': data['email'],\n                'password': raw_password,\n                \"restaurant_name\": data['restaurant_name']\n            }\n            publish(method=\"RESTAURANT_CREATED\", body=data_to_be_published)\n\nProblems we faced\nRabbitMQ was very hard to debug as if a consumer errors out the data in the microservices becomes inconsistent leading to strange behaviour in the app. We were using RabbitMQ hosted on CloudAMQP which sometimes force closed the connection to consumers and that lead to features stopping randomly. Working with RabbitMQ was a very frustrating experience for us and Apache Kafka or Amazon SQS may yield better results.\nConclusion\nThis is how we kept our microservices in sync.
